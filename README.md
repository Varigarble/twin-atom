### TWiN AToM - *The World Needs Another Task Manager!*

A customizable shared calendar program to create assignments for users with descriptions, due dates, etc. Databases are useful. Customized databases with easy to use frontends are much nicer. If a team's calendar program doesn't integrate all the information they need, the world needs another task manager. If a workflow is based on email chains, the world needs another task manager. If everyone on the team has to learn MongoDB, they're probably database engineers and can already build another task manager.

Powered by MongoDB, Flask, Python, test-driven development.

This is a work in progress, but I need something on GitHub to prove I'm still active. As of initial commit, the tests in the unnitest files are passing (on Windows). Anything not covered by the tests is an idea of what to build out.
